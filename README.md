## Description
Online application to manage the reserve of a wine cellar. Built for a personal use so some aspects might be specific.
The project is made with an upload on Google appengine in mind. This is why the "locals" imports are possible and done.
Without them there is a double import when running goapp.

## Technology:
* Go (backend)
* React (expected)
* EcmaScript2015 (expected)
